It is able to detect how much movement is occurring. The concept is quite basic:\r\n\r\n- Grab each frame of the video media\r\n- Compare the current frame with the previous frame\r\n- Perform a difference of the luminosity (grayscale) for every pixel in the frame\r\n- If the luminosity difference is above a certain threshold (0-255), it is counted as a \"movement pixel\"\r\n- The count of how many of these movement pixels is what drives the gauge showing how much movement occurred","google":"UA-2390640-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
